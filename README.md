# Airline_reporting_and_analytical_system

## Description of the final project
In this workshop, we will play the role of a consultant working for one of the air carriers, whose task is to optimize the process of providing and analyzing data.

The data we will use comes from the Kaggle platform we already know - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/2019-airline-delays-and-cancellations.

## Context

Therefore, our company was asked to:

- creating a mechanism for downloading data from the shared API,
- creating a database used for analytical and reporting purposes,
- feeding the database with downloaded data,
- performing exploratory analysis of the data set,
- creating an operational report,
- modeling.
